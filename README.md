# thesis_movieDate

According to a recent study, the main reason why millennial couples break up is because they can't decide what movie to watch.

Movie Date App takes care of that problem by taking the ranking you have given movies within the app, comparing them to the way your partner or friend has rated movies and through a suggestions algorithm, the app will suggest movies that both of you will enjoy watching.

Steps:

1. Create a username.

2. Search and rate movies you have already watch(rate at least 15 movies to have enough data to start producing suggestions).

3. Get the username for the person who you are trying to watch a movie with (if they dont have a username already, have them register and rate at least 15 movies). 

4. Go to the Suggestions tab and input their username.

5. The suggestions will pop up with the best possibilities at the top.

6. Grab some popcorn and enjoy!

*Rememer the more you rank the better the suggestions will become.
